# Test Driven Linked List
## <em>Learning the Boring Stuff</em>

This is a basic implementation of a linked list in JavaScript.

This application was created as an exercise to learn about test driven development and agile software methodologies. The project was created using test driven development, and the repository is linked to a Jira project; the commit that created this readme file references a task.
